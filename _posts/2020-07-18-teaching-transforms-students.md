Outside of my own research, I am very passionate about education in general. Of course, the term "education" is an extremely general one, but the best definition I have put down so far is "the process of helping students on their learning process and thereby changing how they think and ultimately who they are." This is still a very broad definition, I know, but it is intentional. Let me illustrate what this means and how this view has helped me teach by talking about my experience in teaching physics.

Let me first explain/acknowledge how I got to this mode of thought. I first obtained this perspective of education as a holistic, transformative process of the student via various programs at Stanford, including [an SGSI course](https://vpge.stanford.edu/interdisciplinary-learning/sgsi/2018) titled "Identity in the Classroom" and a pedagogy course "[VPTL 312: Science and Engineering Course Design](https://vptl.stanford.edu/node/1066)." In these courses and many other programs, one recurring theme with Stanford education is "the growth mindset" ^[Growth mindset is a term popularized by Carol S. Dweck, a Professor of Psychology at Stanford, through her book "[Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322)."] which is a mindset that believes abilities are something that can be gained and developed, not given at birth and immutable. With this mindset, a teacher must gear any education towards improving the student's abilities, realizing their full potential, and ultimately helping them become who they want to be.

Now, back to my experience teaching physics. Like many other grad students, I served as a teaching assistant (TA) for an introductory physics course during my first-year at Stanford--a class most commonly taken by students majoring in not physics, but other sciences, engineering, or something else. Naturally, most students in the course were not looking to take more upper-level physics courses, and many did not have intrinsic motivation for the course material. To some, this was just a required course for their majors.

Considering the diversity of students' identities and motivations made me think about physics education in a broader context. I first had to motivate them and convince them that physics education will help them achieve their further goals, though that goal may not be becoming a physicist or even having a career in the STEM fields. I had to think about what studying physics and thinking like a physicist mean and how this could be valuable for non-physicists. Indeed, training in physics is valuable beyond the boundaries of physics, for example because many fundamental physical principles generalize well to other academic disciplines and because breaking a complicated problem down into a set of simple, fundamental laws is a useful skill in any field. The ability and confidence to tackle a difficult problem are also crucial values to be gained from physics classes. I have found that this line of reasoning appeals well to a wide range of students, and my effort to emphasize this point was successful in engaging with the students. At the end of the quarter, I was particularly happy to see phrases like "critical thinking skills", "(physical) intuition", or even "confidence and patience" appear in the students' reviews on what they learned from the course.

Thanks to the Internet, it is becoming easier by day to look up any specific set of information and technical details. This is another reason why education, and science education in particular, should emphasize general skills and not just "how to solve the equation of motion."

Now, notice that I have not said anything about "clear explanation" and
