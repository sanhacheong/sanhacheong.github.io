		<h3>GRE in Physics Graduate Admissions</h3>

		<p class="indent">
		The <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/" target="_blank">GRE</a> stands for the <i>Graduate Record Examination</i> and is a standardized test used for admissions to graduate schools and business schools. Just like the SAT, there are the General and the Subject Tests. 
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		The <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about" target="_blank">General GRE</a> measures basic English abilities (critical reading &amp; analytical writing) and quantitative skills. For physics major students, the quantitative section should be pretty easy, though one might need some practice to familiarize oneself with the test format. If a student's undergraduate degree is from an institution whose primary language of instruction is English, the English abilities are usually not a huge concern in the admissions process for Physics graduate programs in US. (It is much more important for an international applicant from a non-English institution.)
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		What <i>does</i> really bug physics students is the <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about/content/physics" target="_blank">Physics GRE</a> (PGRE). The PGRE, as are a lot of standardized tests, is a bad measure of one's understanding of physics or one's ability to succeed in grad school. <i>However</i>, it is unfortunately a non-trivial factor in the admissions for Physics graduate programs in US. A physics department chair at one of the top programs in US once told me, "<i>It</i> (PGRE) <i>doesn't measure what we want to measure, but it measures something</i>." People are becoming more and more aware of how ineffective it is, but, as of now, it is another bump that students aiming for Physics PhD need to get through.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		If you need help preparing for the PGRE, here are some <a href="#tips">tips</a> and <a href="#study_materials">a recommended plan with study materials</a>. Hope this page helps and wish you good luck!
		</p>

	<div class="default-text" id="tips">
		<h3>Basic Info &amp; Tips</h3>
		
		<p class="indent">
		The PGRE consists of 100 <i>multiple-choice</i> (5 options) problems in 170 minutes, with material taken from practically <i>all</i> possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRE_Physics_Test" target="_blank">undergraduate physics topics</a>. The raw score is calculated as "# of correct answers - # of incorrect answers entered / 4" and then re-scaled to a score out of 990. What does this imply?
		</p>

		<p class="indent">
		First, you <i>NEED</i> to be fast. You <i>cannot and should not</i> do all the detailed calculations; dimensional analysis and other intuitions can almost always eliminate a few answers without any calculation. Don't forget to:
		<ul class="nobullet">
			<li class="intext">
				<table>
					<tr class="list">
						<td>Always do dimensional analysis. You would be surprised how many answers are dimensionally incorrect.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="list">
						<td>Test for limiting cases. Does the expression converge/diverge as you would expect? Does it converge to a sensible value?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="list">
						<td>Check for appropriate dependences. Does the expression depend on physical quantities as expected?</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</li>
		</ul>
		Because the penalty for an incorrect answer is only a 1/4 raw score, it is on average more beneficial to guess than to leave a problem unanswered, as far as you can surely eliminate at least one answer choice via the above techniques.
		</p>

		<p class="indent">
		The other, perhaps obvious, point to note is that it is difficult to recall <i>ALL</i> undergrad materials. It will probably require some conceptual reviews, no matter your GPA. (If not, fantastic! You need not worry.) I strongly recommend spending some time on conceptual review of all topics you have learned so far, before jumping into past exams.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		At the same time, it is unrealistic to learn all materials that can possibly be on the exam. <i>However</i>, getting a perfect 990 scaled score does not require a perfect raw score. The scale varies from an exam to another, but a raw score of 80 or so can still correspond to a 990. So, be wise, and don't obsess yourself with perfection. Also, in the topics that you are not so familiar with, the techniques above can really help.
