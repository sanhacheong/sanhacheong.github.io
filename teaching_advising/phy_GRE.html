		<h3>GRE in Physics Graduate Admissions</h3>

		<p class="indent">
		The <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/" target="_blank">GRE</a> stands for the <i>Graduate Record Examination</i> and is a standardized test used for admissions to graduate schools and business schools. Just like the SAT, there are the General and the Subject Tests. 
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		The <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about" target="_blank">General GRE</a> measures basic English abilities (critical reading & analytical writing) and quantitative skills. For physics major students, the quantitative section should be pretty easy, though one might need some practice to familiarize oneself with the test format. If a student's undegraduate degree is from an institution whose primary language of instruction is English, the English abilities are usually not a huge concern in the admissions process for Physics graduate programs in US. (It is much more important for an international applicant from a non-English institution.)
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		What <i>does</i> really bug physics students is the <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about/content/physics" target="_blank">Physics GRE</a> (PGRE). The PGRE, as are a lot of standardized tests, is a bad measure of one's understanding of physics or one's ability to succeed in grad school. <i>However</i>, it is unfortunately a non-trivial factor in the admissions for Physics graduate programs in US. A physics department chair at one of the top programs in US once told me, "<i>It</i> (PGRE) <i>doesn't measure what we want to measure, but it measures something</i>." People are becoming more and more aware of how ineffective it is, but, as of now, it is another bump that students aiming for Physics PhD need to get through.
