	<h2>Research</h2>

	Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding <i>the fundamental laws of nature</i>, in both the smallest and the largest scales. In physics, such fields are typically classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics" target="_blank">particle physics</a>, which studies the smallest fundamental particles that consist nature and mediate fundamental forces, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology">cosmology</a>, which studies the largest-scale dynamics of the universe and its history.
	</p>
	<p class="indent">
	What is fascinating is that the study of the two regimes are not unrelated, but in fact <i>closely knit</i> together. For instance, Astronomical observations suggest the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter" target="_blank">dark matter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy" target="_blank">dark energy</a>, which hint at imperfections in particle physics and quantum field theory. Similarly, particle physics is important for cosmology, because the universe was in a much smaller and hotter state at its early stage.

	<p class="indent">
	The amount of experimental and observational data used in these areas are <i>extremely large</i> and growing faster than ever before, and the analyses naturally require advanced computer algorithms. Hence, I am interested in the applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank">deep learning</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory" target="_blank">network theory</a>, and other novel algorithms to facilitate physics research and also artificial intelligence in general.

	<h3>For non-experts</h3>

	As a grad student, I work on the <a href="https://atlas.cern" target="_blank">ATLAS</a> experiment at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a>, located in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC accelerates charged particles like protons to extremely high kinetic energy (close to the speed of light) and collide them into each other. This creates an environment with extremely high energy-density&mdash;similar to the universe during its early times&mdash;where a series of energetic events that are rare or unavailable in our daily lives such as the creation of heavier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark" target="_blank">quarks</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson" target="_blank">Higgs boson</a> happen. Such dynamics is observed via particle detectors located around the LHC, one of which is ATLAS.
