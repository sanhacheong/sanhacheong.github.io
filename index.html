		I am a Physics PhD student at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>, studying experimental particle physics and cosmology. Currently, I work on the <a href="http://atlas.cern">ATLAS</a> experiment. More generally, I am interested in the intersection of particle physics and cosmology, the interface between theories and experiments, the applications of deep learning and other novel algorithms in physics, and artificial intelligence. I am also very passionate about physics education and career counseling.

		Outside of physics, I spend time writing, playing and watching basketball, playing around with non-physical datasets, and (most importantly) sleeping.

		Before coming to Stanford, I was an undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.rochester.edu">University of Rochester</a>. I graduated in May 2017 with a B.S. in Physics & Astronomy with Highest Distinction and a B.A. in Mathematics. As an undergrad, I worked with Prof. Demina on cosmological data analysis research, preparing for the <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov">DESI</a> project.
