  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ site.base }}assets/img/profile.jpg" style="float: right; margin:0px; padding: 5px 5px 10px 20px;" align="right" width=240px height=240px/>
    I am a Physics PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>. I mainly work on the <a href="https://atlas.cern" target="_blank">ATLAS Experiment</a> located at <a href="https://home.cern/", target="_blank">CERN</a>. Recently, I also started working on another experiment called <a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2019/09/magis-100-atoms-in-free-fall-to-probe-dark-matter-gravity-and-quantum-science/", target="_blank">MAGIS-100</a>, a new fundamental physics experiment utilizing atom interferometry, which will be installed at <a href="https://www.fnal.gov/", target="_blank">Fermilab</a>.

    My main physics interests include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">the Higgs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a>, and exotic signatures of new physics. In order to pursue such physics, I mainly work on the development of new data analysis methods, including applications of machine learning, and the development of future experimental equipments, like silicon pixel detectors.

    I am also very passionate about STEM education, advising/mentoring, and diversity &amp; inclusion in the STEM academia. I have been developing and teaching <a href="https://phys266.stanford.edu/">PHYSICS 166/266</a>, a new course on statistics for physics students. I also work with <a href="https://ctl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Center for Teaching &amp; Learning</a> to train other teaching assistants and improve teaching across the university.

    Before coming to Stanford, I did my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://www.rochester.edu" target="_blank">University of Rochester</a>. I graduated in May 2017 with a B.S. in Physics &amp; Astronomy with Highest Distinction and a B.A. in Mathematics. With <a href="https://www.pas.rochester.edu/people/faculty/demina_regina/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Regina Demina</a>, I worked on observational cosmology research and formed the Rochester cosmology group. More specifically, I developed a new data analysis algorithm for studying galaxy distributions and large-scale structures in our universe, in preparation for the <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov" target="_blank">DESI</a> project.

  <p>
    Outside of physics, I spend time writing, playing and watching basketball, playing around with non-physics datasets, and (most importantly) sleeping.
