  I am a Physics PhD student at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>, studying experimental particle physics and cosmology. Currently, I work on the <a href="https://atlas.cern" target="_blank">ATLAS</a> experiment at the <a href="https://atlas.slac.stanford.edu/", target="_blank"> SLAC Group</a>. More generally, I am interested in the intersection of particle physics and cosmology, the interface between theories and experiments, the applications of deep learning and other novel algorithms in physics, and artificial intelligence. I am also very passionate about physics education and career counseling.

  Outside of physics, I spend time writing, playing and watching basketball, playing around with non-physical datasets, and (most importantly) sleeping.

  Before coming to Stanford, I did my undergraduate at <a href="https://www.rochester.edu" target="_blank">University of Rochester</a>. I graduated in May 2017 with a B.S. in Physics &amp; Astronomy with Highest Distinction and a B.A. in Mathematics. As an undergrad, I worked with <a href="https://www.pas.rochester.edu/people/faculty/demina_regina/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Regina Demina</a> on cosmological data analysis research, preparing for the <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov" target="_blank">DESI</a> project.
