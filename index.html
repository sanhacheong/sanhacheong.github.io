  I am a Physics PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> working on the <a href="https://atlas.cern" target="_blank">ATLAS Experiment</a> at the <a href="https://atlas.slac.stanford.edu/", target="_blank">SLAC Group</a>. My main physics interests include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">the Higgs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a>, and exotic signatures of potential new physics. In order to pursue such physics and improve the reach of the ATLAS Experiment, I work on the developement of new data analysis methods in particle physics including applications of machine learning, as well as the development of future detectors. More broadly speaking, I am interested in the intersection between particle physics and cosmology, the interface between theories and experiments, the applications of machine learning and other novel algorithms in physics research, and artificial intelligence. I am also very passionate about STEM education, advising/mentoring, and diversity &amp; inclusion in the STEM academia. I use he/him pronouns.

  Before coming to Stanford, I did my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://www.rochester.edu" target="_blank">University of Rochester</a>. I graduated in May 2017 with a B.S. in Physics &amp; Astronomy with Highest Distinction and a B.A. in Mathematics. As an undergrad, I worked with <a href="https://www.pas.rochester.edu/people/faculty/demina_regina/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Regina Demina</a> on observational cosmology research, developing a new data analysis algorithm for studying galaxy distributions and large-scale structures in our universe and preparing for the <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov" target="_blank">DESI</a> project.

  Outside of physics, I spend time writing, playing and watching basketball, playing around with non-physics datasets, and (most importantly) sleeping.
