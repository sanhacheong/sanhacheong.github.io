		I am a Physics PhD student at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>, studying experimental particle physics and cosmology. Currently, I work on the <a href="http://atlas.cern">ATLAS</a> experiment. More generally, I am interested in the intersection of particle physics and cosmology, the interface between theories and experiments, the applications of deep learning and other novel algorithms in physics, and artificial intelligence. I am also very passionate about physics education and career counseling.
		<br>
		Outside of physics, I spend time writing, playing and watching basketball, playing around with non-physical datasets, and sleeping.
